Current project focused on developing an automated system for grading exam papers by recognizing numerical handwritten digits using two machine learning classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes. The KNN classifier, which classifies digits based on the closest neighbors with weighted voting, achieved a high overall accuracy of  96.91%, demonstrating strong performance across all digit classes. In contrast, the Naive Bayes classifier, which assumes Gaussian distribution of features, attained a lower overall accuracy of  77.46% and exhibited more variability in performance across different digits. The project's findings suggest that KNN is the more robust and reliable approach for accurate digit recognition in the context of automating exam grading, making it a suitable choice for this application.
